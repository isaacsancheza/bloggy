# Welcome

This is a **live demo** of MDXEditor with all <u>features</u> on.

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible.
> The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text,
> without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

[— Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

In here, you can find the following markdown elements:

* Headings
* Lists
  * Unordered
  * Ordered
  * Check lists
  * And nested ;)
* Links
* Bold/Italic/Underline formatting
* Tables
* Code block editors
* And much more.

The current editor content is styled using the \`@tailwindcss/typography\` [plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin).

## What can you do here?

This is a great location for you to test how editing markdown feels. If you have an existing markdown source, you can switch to source mode using the toggle group in the top right, paste it in there, and go back to rich text mode.

If you need a few ideas, here's what you can try:

1. Add your own code sample
2. Change the type of the headings
3. Insert a table, add a few rows and columns
4. Switch back to source markdown to see what you're going to get as an output
5. Test the diff feature to see how the markdown has changed
6. Add a frontmatter block through the toolbar button

## A table

Play with the table below - add rows, columns, change column alignment. When editing,
you can navigate the cells with \`enter\`, \`shift+enter\`, \`tab\` and \`shift+tab\`.
